"You do any sports? Any martial arts perhaps? I still remember back when you were doing it. Yeah, I still continued with Taekwondo. It's been a real long ride. I'm now going to several competitions with many of my friends. They're also in the same situation as me. I'm past my back bell. I've been past it since the middle of my university. Now, I hope I could maybe end up winning a national someday overseas, that would be a very interesting experience as well."
