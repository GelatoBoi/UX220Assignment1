"Aside from that, yeah, all my hobbies are still the same. I still do Fishkeeping a lot. Now I have Huge freshwater fish tanks, but I'm thinking in debating whether or not I should get into saltwater. It seems like new territory for me Because the water parameters are different and everything is different in that hobby. It's almost like as if it's a completely different hobby, but it's something that I really want to try as well." 

"You have to go now or? Can I get your contact? Yeah, that's nice. We live close To each other anyways, so we might as well just see each other again someday. OK, make sure you take your flight. Take care. See you."
