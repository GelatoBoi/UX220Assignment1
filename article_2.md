"You asked which job I'm taking? Remember I internship after my first year in university? The one at the company called FCT? Yeah, I work there now. Full time. My team is the same as it was just like back then and I really enjoy it. I actually know a lot more about title insurance now, and I feel like maybe one day in my future career I could end up becoming a real estate agent, maybe as like a side job. It would be an interesting experience to say the least."
