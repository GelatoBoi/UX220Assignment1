<b> 
The correlation between personal goals & academic building
</b> 

When it comes to working and building on ourselves, one of the main factors that helps boost that growth the most is personal goal setting. With discipline, personal goal setting can help set academic routines, increase academic and physical performance, improve mental health, etc. This is proven with a theory labelled the "goal-setting theory." (Travers et al.) The theory explains that environmental stresses and situations can help create a positive charge to enhance goals and behaviour, which is achievable for everyone. (Travers et al.) 

On the one hand, I have applied this goal-setting to myself when it comes to my academic and physical goals; however, the same cannot be said about my hobby or career goals. My hobby and career goals are different by nature, and although some may debate that career goals are similar to my academic or physical goals, I tend to see it differently. How I see it for my career, goal-setting theory is very different, as in a career, setting goals can change and be replaced in no time.
